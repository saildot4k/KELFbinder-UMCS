### UMCS Required Directories:
- **SYS-CONF**: Contains universal configurations for many applications and exploits.
- **BOOT**: Contains the heart of UMCS, contains essential ELFs and their local settings.
- **B?EXEC-SYSTEM**: PS2BBL Exploit relevant to your console(s) region(s).


### Emergency Access:
If all three primary boot options fail:
- Hold `START + R1` during boot or reboot of PS2 to launch **mass://RESCUE.ELF** Recommended to download wLE ISR exFAT and rename to RESCUE.ELF. Place at root of usb stick and insert into PS2 usb port.
- Modify launch order or applications via:
  - `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PS2BBL.INI`
  - `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PSXBBL.INI`
- Alternative launchers (e.g., `mass:/XEB+/XEBPLUS.ELF`) can be configured to launch using wLaunchELF's built-in text editor. UMCS is designed to be easily configured for custom boot.

### Additional Notes:
- Applications are accessible if installed; however, removing unused applications via the PS2 Browser (Memory Card Icon Screen) is recommended to free space.
- Customize boot preferences by editing: `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PS2BBL.INI`
- PSX consoles (PSX-DESR) default to launching wLaunchELF (configured via `PSXBBL.INI`).
- OSDMENU settings (`OSDMENU.CNF`) can be customized via wLaunchELF's text editor.

### Compatibility with Late PS2 Slim Models:
For late-model slim consoles incompatible with standard exploits or if you have a card that is not MagicGate capable, install any update even though it might say incompatible, and then launch the included OpenTuna Icon Installer to gain access to UMCS via OpenTuna. **OpenTuna Installer: UMCS is *EXTREMELY* SLOW! NOT FROZEN! Be patient, its not frozen - it will always throw you an error message if it has a problem. (Which it shouldn't)**

## üí° NEED HELP?

Reread the steps, or ask the community ‚Äî we‚Äôre here to help!
If KELFBinder is not launching for you, try using a [different version of wLaunchELF](https://israpps.github.io/projects/wlaunchelf-isr).
If START isn't Booting wLaunchELF, place any program ELF on USB and rename it RESCUE.ELF - this will allow you to launch it when all other options fail by pressing R1 + Start.
If KELFBinder won't load on your console, you can use [Free McBoot Installer: UMCS](https://github.com/NathanNeurotic/FreeMcBoot-Installer-UMCS/releases/tag/latest) for the same installation instead.
